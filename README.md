# RobinStax

With RobinStax, you can 'mock' invest in the stock market! Build your very own portfolio cost-free, and once you're ready, you can take it to the real markets.

## Technlogies

RobinStax is built on **Ruby on Rails, PosgresSQL, JavaScript, React.js, and Redux.js.**
Additionally, RobinStax uses **IEX Cloud API** to capture real-time market information, such as stock quotes and historical data. RobinStax uses AJAX calls to request information from IEX, takes the data in, and formats the data for useability.
RobinStax also uses **Recharts**, a chart library powered by **D3**, to display the data from IEX in the form of dynamic charts.

Here's what a user's portfolio looks like:

## Features

One of the main features of RobinStax is the ability of a user to buy and sell stock. First, a user can use the search bar to enter a company's stock symbol, which will then render the company's information, and also a quick menu on the right which will allow the user to buy or sell an amount of the stock.

Another cool feature is the ability of a user to create watchlists, where users can keep track of companies they are interested in.

## Highlights

One of the funnest things to work on for RobinStax was implementing the graphs on a user's portfolio page and the companies' stock pages. The Graph is from Recharts library (powered by D3), and so learning how to use the library took some time to research and experiment.
